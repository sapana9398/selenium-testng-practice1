# Selenium TestNG Practice Project

This project is created to practice Selenium Automation Testing using Java and TestNG.
It follows basic automation framework concepts such as Page Object Model, TestNG execution, and logging.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- Maven
- Log4j2 (basic logging)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

---

## Project Structure
All automation code is maintained under `src/test/java`.

- **basePage** – Common reusable methods for page classes
- **baseTest** – Test setup and teardown logic
- **pageClasses** – Page Object Model classes implemented using Page Factory
- **testScripts** – TestNG test cases
- **utilities** – Helper and utility classes

---

## TestNG XML Files
- **MultipleBrowserTestNG.xml**  
  Used to execute test cases on multiple browsers.

- **ParallelExecutionTestNG.xml**  
  Used to execute test cases in parallel using TestNG.

---

## Logging
- Basic logging is implemented using **Log4j2**
- Logs are generated in a `logs` folder for test execution tracking

---

## Application Under Test
Automation is performed on a public demo e-commerce website used for practice:
